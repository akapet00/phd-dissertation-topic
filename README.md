# PhD topic

This repository contains the code I used for figures and analysis presented on the defense of the topic of the doctoral thesis.

To reproduce the results, the easiest way is to create a local environment by using `conda` as
```shell
conda create --name phd-dissertation-topic python=3.9.12
```
and, inside the environment, within `code` repository, run the following command
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
