# PhD topic

This repository contains the code I used for generating figures and performing analysis that served for for the application and defense of the topic of the doctoral thesis.

To reproduce the results, the easiest way is to create a local environment by using `conda` as
```shell
conda create --name phd-dissertation-topic python=3.9.12
```
and, inside the environment, within `code` repository, run the following command
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
